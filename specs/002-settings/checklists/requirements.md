## Notes

- All three clarification questions raised during drafting (Users-screen create entry point,
  Employee Setup route placement, mobile list layout) were resolved with the user before this spec
  was finalized; see the Clarifications section in spec.md.
- This spec was drafted immediately after amending the constitution to add Principle VI
  (Responsive & Mobile-First Design); FR-021/SC-005 reflect that new principle.
- A `/speckit-clarify` pass found and resolved a self-contradiction in the original Users-screen
  access description (FR-010) and a missing accessibility standard (now FR-024/SC-008); see the
  second Clarifications session in spec.md.
